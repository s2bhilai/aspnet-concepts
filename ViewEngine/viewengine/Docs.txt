1) Once the request reaches the action and action executed, AspNet calls the GetView method in your custom
   IViewEngine class.
2) If GetView successfully loads a template requested by action, it responds with success response.
3) This response in turn creates a new instance of View Engine's IView ready to render the found template.
4) If it does not find the requested template, the request is handed to FindView method of IViewEngine in order
   to search different places to locate the template.
5) GetView is called for every action in every view engine.
6) If FindView also fails to locate the template and error out, this signals to ASP.NET that the template
   for the request is not found.
7) The View Engine at this point returns the list of searched locations which in turn returns the view not
   found page.
8) If FindView reports as successful, then we proceed as for GetView being successful, and instantiate an 
   IView custom class.
9) IView class has a method - Render whose job is to take the available data and the template and merge them into 
   the final page response to return to the server.
10) Data is collected and packaged in a controller action, then handed to IViewEngine,IView pair in its packaged form
    usually in object form or ViewData structures.
